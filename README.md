A Collision Avoidance and warning mechanism which will provide automated braking and steering mechanism 

Sensors used:  

    Two cameras one at front and one at back:
    To get a video feed both at front and back of the Car to assume the best algorithm to apply in that senariuo with all others sensor data.

    lidar sensor:
    Light sensor is used to get the accurate distance between obsticls like car,sidewalk and walking person exactra.

    GPS:
    GPS is used to get accurate position of our ka to to implement that in our algorithm before hand how was the road on next s like where it was turning and when was the red light where it can be jam or more cars exactra

    Speed in encoder:
    Speed encoder used to get accurate measurement of our car speed. we can also use GPS for it but using a separate speed encoder give us more accurate reading as in this situation we need that.
